      <h3>About me<span style="color: #ffd911;">:</span></h3>
      <p class="frame-olive" style="color: white;">I am a dynamic media professional with exposure over the last two decades across print and digital media. I have worked as a all-round video producer and documentary film maker by working on a wide range of media campaigns and projects.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have always been committed to my personal and professional development and making my life and people around me better. Currently I am taking part in a software Development Course run by Code Your Future in London. It is a new territory for me and I am so excited to explore the challenges and the opportunities in the IT industry.

      <h4>1997<span style="color: #ffd911;">:</span>my first contact with HTML 3<span style="color: #ffd911;">.</span>2<span style="color: #ffd911;">!</span></h4>
      <p class="frame-grey">I was in my last years of high school when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">Iran</a> - my country of origin - became the second country in the Middle East to be connected to the Internet.<br>
      <br>
      When I became a student at Tehran University in 1997, it was the golden age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">HTML3.2</a> code-heavy blogs of the late '90s.<br>
      <br>
      I started writing a personal blog and at the time, there were not many blog templates and users had to make their own basic adjustments to the code, and it was when I was first introduced to coding!<br></p>

      <h4>2012<span style="color: #ffd911;">:</span> Setteling in the United Kingdom<span style="color: #ffd911;">:</span></h4>
      <p class="frame-grey">I started to work as a journalist in the late 1990s and early 2000s while studying at Tehran university. By the time, technology changed and I became more interested in digital media. After finishing my bachelor's degree in Business Economics in Iran, I traveled to India and studied for a Master's degree in Electronic Media (2007) and then moved to London and studied a Master's degree in International Journalism (2011).<br>
      <br>
      I had to seek asylum in the UK in 2012 and I have worked as a digital journalist and TV producer since then in London.<br></p>

      <h4>2022<span style="color: #ffd911;">:</span> Why changing my career<span style="color: #ffd911;">?</span> Why now<span style="color: #ffd911;">?</span></h4>
      <p class="frame-green">As a refugee settled in the UK, I have worked so hard to get myself and my family where I am today. Although it's not always easy to get a fair job as a refugee, I consider myself to be so lucky to have a creative job in the media industry and I believe that it's time for me to boost my career by combining my work experience in media and coding.<br>
      <br>
      To cut my long story short, I think my main motivation to become a full-stack web developer is hidden in the name of the organization: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;"><strong>CODE YOUR FUTURE!</strong></a> I must learn to code and change my life!<br></p>
